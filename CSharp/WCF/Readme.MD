# WCF test groiup

## Background

This project is to summarized my learning on WCF given code sample

## Topics

Simple WCF

Simple WCF with nHibernate

Simple WCF with EntityFramework

Simple WCF Restful


## Questions:

1. Do WCF support in .NET core?

	No for server, Yes for client. please see https://github.com/dotnet/wcf/releases/tag/v2.0.0
	I think web API is favor instead of WCF: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio
