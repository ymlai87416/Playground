## 1. Learn to draw a rounded edge rectangle in WPF.

Why? Telerik report is so dump that it does not provide a rounded edge rectangle shape... force me to create one by myself. This is to test my implementation.

Idea from: https://nacho4d-nacho4d.blogspot.hk/2011/05/bezier-paths-rounded-corners-rectangles.html

## 2. Service Provideer - Broker - Client WCF infrastructure

I have to write a Broker to bridge client and service provider, I want log what between service provider and the broker using Castle Dynamic Proxy library

Project Introduction

	*WCFServiceObject to store object to be referenced by service provider, broker and the client

	*WCFService1: The service provider

	*WCFService2: The Broker

	*WCFService2Controller: The Broker controller logic, which Castle Dynamic Proxy is applied here to do the trick.
